 This script is my submission for the course project portion of the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data online course offered  by  John Hopkins. The below script reads in sensor data from: 
 https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
 combines the training and test sets then calculates averages for all columns with std and mean. The output 
 is Step_Five_Tidy_Data.csv
 
 This repo contains the following files:
 1. run_analysis.R: this is the R script which performs the cleansing and merging tasks
 2. CodeBook.md: this contains step-by-step instructions on the data transformations
 
 To successfully execute run_analysis.R, first download the requisite .zip file and place in the working directory (specify the directory  in lines 29 and 30 of the script).
